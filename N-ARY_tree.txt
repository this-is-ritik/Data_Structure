n ary trees means n is the degree of trees

every node can have 0..n children nodes

degree of a tree is pre-decided can not be judged by seeing the tree

strict m-ary trees
means every node should have degree either 0 or m

// Q. if height is h 
    // min nodes required is : m*h+1
    // max nodes are : 2^0+2^1+2^2+.....2^h = ( ( m^(h+1) ) - 1)/(m-1)
    
    //Q.if no of nodes are : n
    // min height = logh( n*(m-1) + 1) - 1
    // max height = (n-1)/m


no of external nodes = e
no of internal nodes = i
with a m-ary tree

e=(m-1)*i + 1



Lets consider the tree : 


                        A
                    B       C    
                D      E,F     G


index is horizontally increasing level by level

Array : A,B,C,D,E,F,G
 
if index of array starts from 0
left child is 2*i+1
right child is 2*i+2
parent is (i-1)/2

for an index i
